# Tic Tac Toe Game

Welcome to my first project! This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. As a beginner, I am still learning JavaScript and this project serves as a way for me to practice and improve my coding skills.

## Introduction

This project is a basic implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game. It's built with a combination of front-end technologies, including HTML for the structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for the game logic.
